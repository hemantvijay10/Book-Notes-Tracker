Placeholder Image Instructions

This folder should contain a file named "no-cover.png" which serves as a placeholder image for books without cover images.

You can create this placeholder image yourself using any image editing software or online tool:

Option 1: Create your own image
1. Create a 300x450 pixel image (standard book cover size)
2. Add text like "No Cover Available" or "Book Cover Not Found"
3. Use a neutral background color like light gray
4. Save as "no-cover.png" in this folder

Option 2: Download a free placeholder image
1. Visit a free image site like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay
2. Search for "book placeholder" or "book cover"
3. Download and resize to 300x450 pixels
4. Save as "no-cover.png" in this folder

Option 3: Use a simple solid color
1. Create a 300x450 pixel image with a solid color
2. Save as "no-cover.png" in this folder

The application will automatically use this image when a book does not have a valid ISBN or when the Open Library API cannot find a cover.
